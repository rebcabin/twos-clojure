;;; --------- DESIGN APPROACH --------------------------------------------

;;; Many data types come with a protocol, a record type, a spec, and tests.

;;; The protocol for each type declares functions. Types that adhere to the
;;; protocol implement those functions. For instance, the MessageQueueT protocol
;;; declares that every message queue must implement "fetch-bundle,"
;;; "insert-message (with potential annihilation)," and "delete-message-by-mid."

;;; Two types implement this protocol: input queues and output queues. The
;;; signatures of these functions are identical for both types even though those
;;; two types of queues are prioritized differently (by receive-time for input
;;; queues and by send-times for output queues).

;;; A record for a type (1) provides constructors, (2) implements protocols, (3)
;;; relieves clojure.spec from specifying required fields. For instance, we do
;;; not need to spec each field of a message if we define a record that requires
;;; those fields. Even when there is only one record type implementing a given
;;; protocol, record seems the most elegant way to package the relationships
;;; amongst protocols, hashmap-like data structures, and specs. There is a
;;; discussion of this issue in the Clojure groups [at this
;;; URL](https://goo.gl/5USUP9).

;;; Specs assert logical properties of (instances of) types. For instance, the
;;; spec for an ::input-queue asserts that every input-queue must be a
;;; ::priority-map prioritized on "vals," with "val" being the second element of
;;; each key-value pair. Every "val" must be a virtual time and every
;;; virtual-time must equal the receive-time of the message that resides in the
;;; key position of each key-value pair in the priority map. The spec generates
;;; tests in which the virtual times are pulled from the receive-time fields of
;;; messages. The tests in the main test file, core_test.clj, check this
;;; property (somewhat vacuously, because the property is true by construction;
;;; the test future-proofs us against changes in the spec and its test
;;; generator). The tests check this property with a "defspec" that lives in the
;;; test file (see test #23.)

;;; Tests of assertions that are true by construction is intentional. Expressly
;;; writing down such obvious cases ones is cheap future-proofing and only bulks
;;; up the test file.

;;; -------- NAMING CONVENTIONS -----------------------------------------

;;; The names of "private-ish" functions begin with a hyphen. Such functions may
;;; still be called, say for testing, without the fully qualified
;;; namespace-and-var syntax (@#'foobar).

;;; -------- DEFRECORD --------------------------------------------------

;;; Records are in kebab-case, sometimes prepended with "tw-" to avoid ambiguity
;;; with more general ideas like "messages". Records create Java classes in
;;; partial snake_case behind the scenes. For instance, the fully qualified name
;;; of the message record type is time_warp.core.message.

;;; (defrecord tw-message   [sender send-time ...]
;;; (defrecord input-queue  [iq-priority-map]
;;; (defrecord output-queue [oq-priority-map]
;;; (defrecord tw-state     [send-time ...]
;;; (defrecord tw-process   [event-main ...]

;;; -------- DEFPROTOCOLS -----------------------------------------------

;;; Protocols are in PascalCase and suffixed with a "T," which means "type" and
;;; reminds us of the common C and C++ convention.

;;; (defprotocol MessageT
;;; (defprotocol MessageQueueT
;;; (defprotocol StateQueueT
;;; (defprotocol ProcessQueueT

;;; -------- PRIMARY SPECS -----------------------------------------------

;;; Specs for records are autoresolved keywords (double-colon), with names
;;; exactly like the records they refer to, with leading "tw-" removed.

;;; (s/def ::virtual-time
;;; (s/def ::message (s/and ::potentially-acausal-message-hashmap ...
;;; (s/def ::state   (s/keys :req-un [::send-time ::body]))
;;; (s/def ::process (s/keys :req-un [::event-main ...

;;; -------- SUBORDINATE SPECS -------------------------------------------

;;; Time Warp is a Virtual-Time Operating System. It uses abbreviated
;;; nomenclature traditional in operating systems like "mid" for "message-id,"
;;; "pid" for "process-id," and "pcb" for "process-control block."
